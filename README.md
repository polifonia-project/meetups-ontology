# MEETUPS Ontology module for MEETUPS PILOT

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/436452967.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/436452967)

The ontology module MEETUPS, which is part of the Polifonia Ontology Network, represents concepts and relationships describing encounters between people in the musical world in Europe from c. 1800 to c. 1945.

## Ontology description

Typically, historical meetups, which are the main subject of this module, are described by means of four main components: (i) the people involved in the meetup, for instance, the person that is the subject of interest and the people interacting in the event, (ii) the place where the encounter took place (e.g., city, country, venue), the type of event, the reason (e.g., music making, personal life, business, among others) and the date when it took place.

This ontology module is strictly related to the Polifonia pilot MEETUPS: https://github.com/polifonia-project/meetups_pilot
